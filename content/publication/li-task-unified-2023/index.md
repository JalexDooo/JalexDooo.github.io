abstract: Abstract Quantification of the cardiac function is vital for diagnosing
  and curing the cardiovascular diseases. Left ventricular function measurement is
  the most commonly used measure to evaluate the function of cardiac in clinical practice,
  how to improve the accuracy of left ventricular quantitative assessment results
  has always been the subject of research by medical researchers. Although considerable
  efforts have been put forward to measure the left ventricle (LV) automatically using
  deep learning methods, the accurate quantification is yet a challenge work as a
  result of the changeable anatomy structure of heart in the systolic diastolic cycle.
  Besides, most methods used direct regression method which lacks of visual based
  analysis. In this work, a deep learning segmentation and regression task-unified
  network with transformer and spatial–temporal convolution is proposed to segment
  and quantify the LV simultaneously. The segmentation module leverages a U-Net like
  3D Transformer model to predict the contour of three anatomy structures, while the
  regression module learns spatial–temporal representations from the original images
  and the reconstruct feature map from segmentation path to estimate the finally desired
  quantification metrics. Furthermore, we employ a joint task loss function to train
  the two module networks. Our framework is evaluated on the MICCAI 2017 Left Ventricle
  Full Quantification Challenge dataset. The results of experiments demonstrate the
  effectiveness of our framework, which achieves competitive cardiac quantification
  metric results and at the same time produces visualized segmentation results that
  are conducive to later analysis.
