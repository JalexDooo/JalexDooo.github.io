 abstract = {The accurate and robust automatic segmentation of cardiac structures in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is signiﬁcant in calculating cardiac clinical functional indices, and diagnosing heart diseases. Most U-Net based methods use pooling, transposed convolution, and skip connection operations to integrate the multiscale features for improved segmentation in cardiac MRI. However, this architecture lacks adequate semantic connection between the channel and spatial information, and robustness in segmenting objects with signiﬁcant shape variations. In this paper, a new multiscale feature attentive U-Net for cardiac MRI structural segmentation method is proposed. An attention mechanism is adopted after concatenating the multi-level features to aggregate different scale features and determine on which features to focus. Cascade and parallel dilated convolution is also employed in the decoder blocks and skip connection is employed to enhance the ability of sensing receptive ﬁelds for multiscale context information. Furthermore, deep supervision approach with a loss function that combines the dice and cross-entropy losses to reduce overﬁtting and ensure better prediction is introduced. The proposed method was evaluated on three public cardiac datasets. The experimental results indicate that the method achieved competitive segmentation performance with the three datasets, which veriﬁes the robustness and generalisability of the proposed network. In comparison with conventional U-Net methods, the model leverages attention mechanism and dilated convolution block, which increases the semantic connection between the channel and the spatial information, and improves the robustness of the right ventricle segmentation performance. From the view of the Dice scores and segmentation results, the multiscale feature attentive U-Net method is one of effective methods in segmenting cardiac MRI structures.},
