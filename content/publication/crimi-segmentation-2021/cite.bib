 abstract = {Gliomas are the most common brain tumors, which have a high mortality. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful to assess gliomas, in which segmentation of multimodal brain tissues in 3D medical images is of great signiﬁcance for brain diagnosis. Due to manual job for segmentation is time-consuming, an automated and accurate segmentation method is required. How to segment multimodal brain accurately is still a challenging task. To address this problem, we employ residual neural blocks and a U-Net architecture to build a novel network. We have evaluated the performances of diﬀerent primary residual neural blocks in building U-Net. Our proposed method was evaluated on the validation set of BraTS 2020, in which our model makes an eﬀective segmentation for the complete, core and enhancing tumor regions in Dice Similarity Coeﬃcient (DSC) metric (0.89, 0.78, 0.72). And in testing set, our model got the DSC results of 0.87, 0.82, 0.80. Residual convolutional block is especially useful to improve performance in building model. Our proposed method is inherently general and is a powerful tool to studies of medical images of brain tumors.},
