abstract: Gliomas are the most common brain tumors, which have a high mortality. Magnetic
  resonance imaging (MRI) is useful to assess gliomas, in which segmentation of multimodal
  brain tissues in 3D medical images is of great signiﬁcance for brain diagnosis.
  Due to manual job for segmentation is time-consuming, an automated and accurate
  segmentation method is required. How to segment multimodal brain accurately is still
  a challenging task. To address this problem, we employ residual neural blocks and
  a U-Net architecture to build a novel network. We have evaluated the performances
  of diﬀerent primary residual neural blocks in building U-Net. Our proposed method
  was evaluated on the validation set of BraTS 2020, in which our model makes an eﬀective
  segmentation for the complete, core and enhancing tumor regions in Dice Similarity
  Coeﬃcient (DSC) metric (0.89, 0.78, 0.72). And in testing set, our model got the
  DSC results of 0.87, 0.82, 0.80. Residual convolutional block is especially useful
  to improve performance in building model. Our proposed method is inherently general
  and is a powerful tool to studies of medical images of brain tumors.
