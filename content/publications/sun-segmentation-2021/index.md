abstract: Segmentation of multimodal brain tissues from 3D medical images is of great
  signiﬁcance for brain diagnosis. It is required to create an automated and accurate
  segmentation based on deep-learning network due to the manual segmentation is time-consuming.
  However, how to segment medical images accurately and how to build neural network
  effectively with very limited computing resource, is still challenging task. To
  address these problems, we propose a novel model based on 3D fully convolutional
  network. More speciﬁcally, we apply multi-pathway architecture to feature extraction
  so as to effectively extract features from multi-modal MRI images. Different receptive
  ﬁeld of feature have been extracted by adopting 3D dilated convolution in each pathway.
  By evaluating one-pathway model and key components of our model with a set of effective
  training schemes, we analyzed how these alternative methods affect the performance
  of experiments. Our proposed model was evaluated in the Brain Tumor Segmentation
  2019 dataset (BraTS 2019), making an effective segmentation for the complete, core
  and enhancing tumor regions in Dice Similarity Coefﬁcient metric (0.89, 0.78, 0.76)
  for the dataset. Also, we made a practice on BraTS 2018 using the same method with
  the Dice Similarity Coefﬁcient metric of 0.90, 0.79, and 0.77 for the complete,
  core and enhancing tumor regions. Our method is inherently general and is a powerful
  tool to studies of medical images of brain tumors. Our code is available at https://github.com/JalexDooo/
