abstract: Liver cancer has a high mortality rate and is a serious threat to human
  life. The study of automated methods for analyzing liver cancer is very helpful
  to doctors in making a diagnosis. The existing methods tend to ignore the information
  correlation between multiple modalities of magnetic resonance imaging and do not
  design networks for multiple modalities and liver lesions. These methods are deficient
  in liver lesion classification and prediction performance, limiting development
  of the field. Therefore, we consider the information correlation between the multimodalities
  and design a multidimensional dual encoding network that can make full use of the
  information between the eight modalities to improve the classification and the prediction
  performance of liver lesions. It consists of a multidimensional information extraction,
  a dual encoder, and a classification structure. Firstly, a method for the application
  of multimodal data is designed, and the multidimensional information extraction
  module is used to extract two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) information
  from all modalities. Then, the dual encoder is used to improve feature extraction
  and pass multi-scale information to the classification structure. Finally, two differently
  connected networks were used to train the model for joint prediction, improving
  the final results. In this paper, a multiphase magnetic resonance imaging dataset
  containing 498 images was used for the experiments. The method was validated by
  ablation studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving
  balanced F1 scores, Cohen_Kappa, accuracy, and area under curve of 0.781, 0.731,
  0.779, and 0.944, respectively.
