abstract: The precise segmentation of multimodal MRI images is the primary stage of
  tumor diagnosis and treatment. Current segmentation strategies often underutilize
  multiscale features, which can easily lead to loss of contextual information, reduction
  of low-level features and noise interference. To overcome these issues, a 3D multiscale
  local cross-channel residual denoising network (MLRD-Net) for an MRI-based brain
  tumor segmentation algorithm is proposed in this paper. Specifically, we employ
  encoder-decoder structure to connect local and global features, and enhance the
  receptive field of the network. Random slice operation has been conducted to enhance
  robustness. Then, residual blocks with pre-activation operation are developed in
  down-sampling stage, which effectively improves signal propagation along the network
  and alleviates network overfitting. Finally, the local cross-channel denoising mechanism
  is established to eliminate unimportant features without dimensionality reduction.
  Our proposal was evaluated in Brain Tumor Segmentation 2020 dataset (BraTS 2020),
  obtaining significantly improved results with mean Dice Similarity Coefficient metric
  of 0.91, 0.79, and 0.73 for the complete, tumor core, and enhancing tumor regions
  respectively. Besides, we conduct further practice on BraTS 2019, with the mean
  Dice Similarity Coefficient metric of 0.89, 0.80, and 0.75. Massive experiments
  demonstrate that our method is powerful and reliable. It increases little model
  complexity while achieving very competitive performance.
